# Notebooks
The experiments and analysis of this works were made mainly with Jupyter Notebooks,
this repo contains the principal notebooks to be able to run the type of experiments performed.

- Architecture experimentation.
- Frechet Inception Calculation.
- SLERP interpolation.
- Nearest training image.
- Dataset creation for experiments.

Also, contains the notebook utilized for previous work in this thesis.
- Dataset mini exploration.
- Bologna Lens Finding Challenge winners replication.
